# p5-attraction-simulation
A simple runway project to bigger, more bodacious simulations. Basic vector work, acceleration, veloctiy, and a changing trajectory based on user input. 


# Basic logic
Essentially this is a little solar system, assuming a vacuum and no friction or opposing force. I use velocity and acceleration to simulate attraction *kind of* how it exists in 
our world of newtonian physics. 

A possible future project is making this same program, using the gravitation attraction equation (and our very own gravity constant!) to simulate **actual real gravity**. 

It's sub-50 lines, using the p5 lib. I hope you enjoy! As soon as I get a chance I'll host it and show it [here](https://codepen.io/matt_the_thew/project/editor/AdJzem).
